<p>Another thousand of Maine's boys marching down into
Dixie. Bless their dear hearts! If this keeps on much
longer, there will be none left for the hopeful Down-East girls
and full-blown spinsters, whose natural expectations are
warm corners in the hearts of these brave heroes. What a
queer lot of men. Some have left their sweethearts behind
them, I suppose. Heigho! There's no one to leave me
behind. When I think of the good times Down East, it just
makes my mouth water. I'd give a week's wages to catch a
glimpse of some familiar face. (<i>Coming down.</i>) I wish I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
were a man. Nothing I'd like better than to join those ranks
and march with them; but here I must stay and dust chairs
(<i>dusts spitefully</i>) and tables. I know the military tic-tacs&mdash;no,
that isn't right. I mean tactics. (<i>Executes manual
with duster.</i>) Present&mdash;arms&mdash;no&mdash;feathers. Order&mdash;feathers.
Indeed, I'd like to, for my next winter's bonnet,
if there were only some one to pay the bill. Right shoulder,
feathers. (<i>Carries duster to left, in place of right.</i>) Ha,
ha, if any one could see me now, they would take me for
a condensed, awkward squad. (<i>Music outside.</i> <span class="smcap">Polly</span>
<i>marches up and down with duster at right shoulder</i>.) I
can feel the military thrill down to the tips of my toes.
Think of the excitement when the bugle calls, and you hear
the cry, &#8220;Charge feathers&mdash;charge!&#8221; (<i>Charges with duster
at door</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span>, <i>into the face of</i> <span class="smcap">Bijah Bright</span>, <i>who appears with
flag; he is bespattered with mud</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bijah.</span> Phew! pooh&mdash;ah, choh! (<i>Sneezes.</i>) What are
you trying to do, smother a fellow? Giving us the great
Othello act, with me as Desdemona! (<i>Looks at</i> <span class="smcap">Polly</span>.)
Why, no!&mdash;yes, it is, Polly&mdash;Polly Primrose.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Polly.</span> Bijah Bright! Well, I declare!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bijah</span> (<i>taking both of</i> <span class="smcap">Polly's</span> <i>hands</i>). Why, the sight
of you is good for a pair of diseased optics.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Polly.</span> But why are you here in this house?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bijah.</span> It must have been the magnetism of your bright
eyes, Polly. When I was marching along, I felt so drawn
towards this house, sez I to myself, sez I, here, Bijah, is the
place to find rest for your weary bones, and rations for an
aching void. And, behold, I find you, my long-lost treasure.
(<i>Tries to embrace</i> <span class="smcap">Polly</span>, <i>who steps aside</i>.) Ah, Polly
Primrose, the way you've played tag with that vital organ of
my being, the heart that beats for you alone, would frighten
any other man, but I've jest made up my mind,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Polly.</span> Don't be so sure of that, Mr. Bright. Don't

<p><span class="smcap">Bijah</span> (<i>taking both her hands</i>). Wal, now, that's something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
like. When the temperature of your society is at zero,
it makes my very blood congeal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Polly.</span> Where did you come from?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bijah.</span> Right from Oldtown, Polly, chuck full of patriotism
and peace.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Polly.</span> Seems to me those two words don't jine well,
Bijah. Patriotism and fight make the best partnership.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bijah.</span> The fighting is all wrong, Polly. Do you see
that flag? You bet, I'm proud of it. I've made a big wager
that I can carry that flag from Oldtown to New Orleans.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Polly.</span> How do you get along?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bijah.</span> Thus far, swimmingly; from Oldtown to Baltimore
has been a triumphant march, but just here I've
struck something.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Polly.</span> From the looks of that eye, and the mud on that
coat, I should say something had struck you. Bijah, you're
a crank. Your peace and flag won't stir anything down this
way. If you are not both suspended from a tree before you
reach New Orleans, you may think yourself lucky. If your
wits were as sharp and dazzling as your name, you would
shoulder your gun and join that regiment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bijah.</span> Oh, Polly, you're way off. No such work for me.
I am the Standard Bearer. (<i>Takes flag.</i>) Think of the
glory that will shine like a halo about my name. When
posterity shall gently drop a tear for memory's sake, and in

<p><span class="smcap">Polly</span> (<i>beaming with admiration</i>). I declare, Bijah,
jest as much of a poet as ever. Do you remember some of
your poetry at the exhibition of the Oldtown School?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bijah.</span> Indeed I do. When old Deacon Sasafrass
visited the school he always wanted something original; so,
one day, thought I'd give it to him. Let me think&mdash;yes, I

<p>Ha, ha, Polly! Those were good times in Oldtown. Do
you remember them?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Polly.</span> Do I? Don't I?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bijah.</span> When I thought you were the purtiest girl in
town; when the sight of you in your best bib and tucker
made me feel as though there were an ice-cream factory in
full operation on one side, and a hot air furnace on the
other.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Polly.</span> Oh, Bijah!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bijah.</span> But times are changed. The girls are changed,

<p><span class="smcap">Bijah.</span> Old girl.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Polly</span> (<i>indignantly</i>). Bijah!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bijah.</span> Now, don't get excited, Polly; I'm by no means
a blooming flower in the garden of youth myself. I've lived
long enough to find out that money is the root of all evil;
that an old rat is more capable from experience of keeping
out of traps than a young one; that life may be worth living,
but it isn't worth much of anything else; that an old sweetheart
is at least a blessed memory; and so, when this cruel
war is over, I'm going to lay my heart at the feet of&mdash;Miss
Polly Primrose.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Polly.</span> Oh, Bijah!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bijah.</span> In the meantime, as I am rather hungry, a bite
of something from the cupboard wouldn't go bad.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Polly.</span> Then come with me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bijah.</span> Thanks, Polly; but before I accept of your
hospitality, who is the proprietor of this establishment?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Polly.</span> Colonel Gordon Graham.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bijah.</span> What? You don't mean it. (<i>Aside.</i>) Here's
luck. (<i>Aloud.</i>) That grand old fellow?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Polly.</span> Do you know him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bijah.</span> Know him? Wal, I guess. Shot in the back.
A dastardly trick.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Polly</span> (<i>holding out hand</i>). Bijah, give me your hand;
you are my friend for life. The colonel is one of the bravest
and best of men. The shot that brought him down could
not keep him there: for, beckoning to two of his men, he
was carried in their arms to the head of his regiment; and,
waving his sword, led them on, driving the enemy in all
directions. Mr. Randolph Newcomb, one of the fine gentlemen
of the city, professes great friendship for the colonel;
but, I've heard it whispered about, that he tries to make him
out a coward. Oh, I just hate him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bijah.</span> He does, does he? I say, Polly, do they ever
speak of Roger Carruth?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Polly.</span> Law, no; poor Miss Dorothy. She's just as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
bright as ever: but mind you, way down deep, she just
grieves and grieves. I know, for I've seen her, when she
thought she was alone. You see, Mr. Newcomb is down on
Mr. Roger, and he is so intimate with the colonel, who
believes that he is something of a saint, that he has made
the colonel down on him too. That just breaks poor Mrs.
Graham's heart, for Mr. Roger is her brother, you know. I
should think Mr. Roger might send Miss Dorothy some
word, at least, and not leave her to fret her heart out. Oh,
these men, they make me tired. Haven't a thought for any
one besides themselves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bijah.</span> Hush, Polly, don't say that. Haven't I marched
from Oldtown just to catch a glimpse of your sweet face?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Polly.</span> Indeed you haven't. You've done all that for
glory, or, for all I know, some other girl.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bijah.</span> Oh, come, Polly, don't be hard on a fellow. You
don't know how much stock you hold in that tender heart of
mine. Its value is getting higher; better hold on to it, or
some day, when the war is over, and it is above <i>par</i>, you will
wish that you hadn't sold out. Besides, Polly, don't be down
on Roger Carruth; he's &#8220;pure gold.&#8221; He'll come to the
front one of these days, and Mr. Randolph Newcomb won't
stand the fire.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Polly.</span> What do you know about Mr. Newcomb, Bijah?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bijah.</span> Never you mind. Sufficient unto the day, is the
gossip thereof. And O Polly, while that heart of mine is
beating a regular nightly tattoo for you on one side, the other
organ of my being, the stomach, in the most unromantic
manner is clamoring for mid-day rations.</p>

<p>(<span class="smcap">Pinkerton Potts</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Dorothy</span> <i>heard outside laughing</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Polly.</span> Poor thing, so active a poetical brain should not

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Well done, Pinky, that last leap was too much
for you. That's your punishment for insisting upon pouring
into my tired ears, a whole battalion of pretty speeches.
Pride must have a fall. If your shots in battle do not
find a more responsive target, your record will not be an
enviable one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Potts.</span> How can I help it? Such bright eyes and glowing
cheeks cannot but provoke such thoughts to utterance.
I say, Miss Dorothy, you do like a fellow, just a little,
don't you?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Like you? Indeed yes. You are one of the nicest
men I know. There is a large corner of my heart quite
devoted to you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Potts.</span> Well, to be liked is something. But, if you only
knew, how much I thought of you by day, and dreamed of
you by night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Ha, ha! to think of Pinky Potts assuming the
sentimental rôle. Dear me. I never dreamed of such a
thing. Why, you are too old a friend. What should I do, if
I were to fall in love with you? It would spoil all the fun, and
now, you are my devoted slave.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Potts.</span> What's the matter with my being in love and
playing the devoted too?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Never. Now, Pinky, you are just the dearest fellow
in the world, and I am awfully fond of you; you are no
end jolly. So come (<i>offers hand, which</i> <span class="smcap">Potts</span> <i>takes</i>), let's
be friends forever, and keep sentiment out of the question.
(<i>Seriously.</i>) And you know, Pinky, I can never forget
Roger Carruth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Potts.</span> No, Miss Dorothy, and I would not have you.
Roger and I are too old friends. I would not mar his happiness
or yours, for all the world. (<i>Kisses</i> <span class="smcap">Dorothy's</span> <i>hand</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Well said, my noble major. Some day a fascinating
little woman will cross your path who won't say &#8220;nay&#8221; to
your devotion. I hope it will be some one that I shall know,
Pinky, for I shall love her with my whole heart. When the
war is over and Roger comes back&mdash;he will come back,
won't he, Pinky?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Potts.</span> Indeed he will. Never doubt his loyalty, and
some day you will have your reward. Roger is under a
heavy cloud, but penetrated by the warmth of your love it
will in time disperse. Then, Miss Dorothy, you will say
&#8220;good-by&#8221; to tears, and revel in the happiness and sunshine
about you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Pinky, you were wrongly named. You are true blue
every time. (<i>Goes to window.</i>) Pinky, come here. Do
you see that man walking with the Colonel and Mrs. Graham?
That is Mr. Randolph Newcomb&mdash;and&mdash;I don't like him.</p>

that you hear is that Major Pinkerton Potts, formerly officer
in the Union Army, had reached the zenith of success, and
was now dazzling all Europe by his acrobatic feats. Pinky,

well, by remaining here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Newcomb.</span> There is other work besides fighting, Colonel,

<p><span class="smcap">Col.</span> True. And that reminds me of mine. Come,

upon a return; do you think this wise, Mrs. Graham?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ruth.</span> His heart is so full of patriotism, every hour's
delay irritates him. Since he cannot be persuaded, I think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
it wiser to let him go. Yet, I fear for his safety. That shot
in the back was mysterious. Some foe, calling himself friend,
lurks near him; why, I cannot imagine. He is everything
that is true and noble; and whoever fired that shot had some
motive, which one attempt upon the colonel's life will not
satisfy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">New.</span> My dear Mrs. Graham, you are morbid. A colonel's
life is at hazard as well as that of a private. Why
could not the shot from an enemy's rifle have done the work?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ruth.</span> Impossible! the enemy were in front. Only a
coward would do so contemptible a deed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">New.</span> True, there are some without honor, Mrs. Graham.
Your brother, Roger Carruth, for instance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ruth</span> (<i>rising</i>). How dare you, Mr. Newcomb, in my own
home, speak so slightingly of my brother? Why have you
turned against him? When he was first accused of the crime,
you acted as his friend. Since his escape, you never lose an
opportunity to taunt me with his downfall.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">New.</span> Because the evidence against him has strengthened.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ruth.</span> Mr. Newcomb, you call yourself friend. I do not
believe you. Roger is as innocent of that crime as I am,
and you know it. Not content with attempting to overturn
my faith in my brother, you have spared no time or trouble
to turn the colonel against him. He believes in your friendship
so thoroughly, he never thinks to doubt your word.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">New.</span> That is as it should be, Mrs. Graham. And, I
hope, some day, the colonel's wife will favor me with her confidence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ruth.</span> Never. Your very presence is hateful to me, and
could I have my wish you would never again cross this
threshold. The time will come when Roger's innocence will
be proved, and woe to those who are his accusers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">New.</span> Suspect? not much; they are too simple for that.
You are still in the colonel's regiment?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gibbs.</span> Yes. What are your orders?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">New.</span> Are you at any time placed as sentinel near the
colonel's quarters?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gibbs.</span> Yes, any night may find me there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">New.</span> Well, I must take my chances. To inquire after
the colonel's health is sufficient excuse for my appearance in
camp at any time. The colonel has given me a standing
invitation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gibbs.</span> Just before taps.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">New.</span> Good, just the thing. After taps will be the time.
Lights out, everything quiet. Can I depend upon you, Gibbs?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gibbs.</span> You have my word, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">New.</span> Ha, ha! word? do you think that yours is worth
anything?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gibbs.</span> Sometime I hope it will be.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">New.</span> Remember, you owe much to me. Should you
turn traitor, your reckoning will be a sorry one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gibbs.</span> I shall not forget all that you have done for me.
Some day I will pay it back with interest. (<span class="smcap">Dor.</span> <i>hides</i>;

<p><span class="smcap">New.</span> I wonder if I can trust him? He seems docile

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> (<i>frightened, appears from behind portière</i>). What
do I hear? A scheme to take the colonel's life, and by his
best friend too. (<i>Goes to window.</i>) There he goes, oh, the
hypocrite. Now I know why I hate him so. With all his
fine manners, I have not been deceived. Ugh! I hate even
to shake hands with him. Oh dear, if I were only a man,
that I might be near the colonel. Whom shall I tell? Who
will help me? Ruth must not know, she has enough to bear.
(<i>Goes to mantel and takes</i> <span class="smcap">Roger's</span> <i>picture; music</i>.) They
call me gay, Roger, frivolous and heartless. Perhaps I am, but
if they could only look down deep into my heart, they would
find the love for you, burning a strong and steadfast flame.
(<i>Places picture on mantel and stands looking at it.</i>) O,
Roger, why did you leave me? We all believed in your

<p><span class="smcap">Bijah.</span> I shall see him again, Miss Dorothy, and, when
I do, I shall say to him, that the stars in heaven never shone

<p><span class="smcap">Bijah.</span> Wal, before Mr. Roger's sister married Colonel
Graham, Newcomb was all-fired gone on her. I know, for I
was about Baltimore at the time and heard no end of gossip.
You see, Mrs. Graham didn't take to him, and snubbed him
on all occasions. By Jiminy, wasn't he mad! The whole
truth of the matter is, he's bound to be revenged, and takes
what's nearest and dearest. He was the means of the colonel's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
injury, and I'm scared blue for fear that he will try it
again. Roger Carruth has his eye on him, for he has a
double debt to pay. (<span class="smcap">Pete</span> <i>heard playing banjo inside tent</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Potts.</span> What's this? (<i>Goes to tent and brings</i> <span class="smcap">Pete</span>,

<p><span class="smcap">Pete.</span> Please; massa, I's only Pete.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Potts.</span> Where did you come from?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Potts.</span> Well, give us a tune.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Potts.</span> Yes, he will; I can answer for that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pete.</span> All right, massa. I'll play de bes I know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Potts.</span> Good, and here's a quarter for inspiration.</p>

<p>(<span class="smcap">Pete</span> <i>salutes, takes coin, and seats himself on floor</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span>

<p><span class="smcap">Potts.</span> Bravo, bravo! (<span class="smcap">Soldiers</span> <i>applaud, then gradually

like that cheer a man up. If we have many more days of
dead calm and quiet, I shall be tempted to desert the cause
and soothe my troubled spirit with the society of some fair
maiden.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bijah</span> (<i>turns</i> <span class="smcap">Pete</span> <i>around; laughs at coat</i>). You're a
great one, you are. Where did you get that coat?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pete.</span> Massa Colonel gib me dat; he's heaps good to
me, he is. I takes care ob eberyting, and I's his guard.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bijah.</span> His what? Guard? Oh, ho! You mean body-guard.
(<i>Whistles; aside.</i>) Wal, I vum, here's an idea.
We'll work him. (<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Pete</span>.) Go back to your work, Pete.
(<span class="smcap">Pete</span> <i>goes into tent</i>.) Major, I have an idea. (<span class="smcap">Potts</span> <i>comes
down front</i>; <span class="smcap">Bijah</span> <i>takes his arm</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Potts.</span> Isn't it rather dangerous to give it away?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bijah.</span> How can we look out for the colonel? We can't
always be at his side, or he will suspect something. He
must not be warned, his health won't stand that. That small
specimen of black humanity calls himself the colonel's guard;
body-guard, he means. Now, why can't he be warned of the
colonel's danger, and I'll trust him for the rest? He's mightily
taken with the colonel, and you know what a darky's
devotion is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Potts.</span> Bijah, you're a trump! If that is a specimen of
your stock of ideas, you are a valuable man. Pete, come
here. (<span class="smcap">Pete</span> <i>runs out of tent</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bijah.</span> That's all right. Keep your mouth shut.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pete.</span> Like him, massa? Deed I does. He's heaps
good ter me. Look at des yer cloe's.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Potts.</span> You can pay him back for them, if you will.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pete</span> (<i>putting hands in pockets; turns them wrong side

dat?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Potts.</span> Gad, you're a lucky fellow to find such a friend as
that. I wish the colonel would help me find a sweetheart.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pete</span> (<i>grinning</i>). 'Specs for such a fine-lookin gennleman
as you is, massa, de colonel would not have to work
bery hard.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Potts.</span> Thank you, Pete. That's praise worth having.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bijah.</span> I say, Pete, there's some one in this world, that
<i>doesn't</i> love the colonel: you must take good care of him.
One of these fine days some one will try to shoot him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pete.</span> Shoot massa Colonel? Not if Pete can help it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bijah.</span> Mind, you keep both eyes wide open. (<i>Exit</i>

<p><span class="smcap">Pete.</span> Deed I will, massa.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Potts.</span> Pete, my boy, the colonel is one of my dearest

him, but I may be called away at any moment. I commend
him to your care. And remember, the trust is a sacred one.

<p><span class="smcap">Polly.</span> Right in camp, miss; see that tent? I wonder

<p><span class="smcap">Polly</span> (<i>walking about, looking through trees</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span>). Some

<p><span class="smcap">Potts.</span> Why, Polly Primrose, what are you doing here?
(<i>Sees</i> <span class="smcap">Dor.</span>) Miss Dorothy, have you lost your senses? In
camp! How did you enter?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Behold my disguise. (<i>Pulls veil over face; then

sell.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Polly.</span> Yes, do have one. (<i>Offers cakes.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Potts</span> (<i>taking one</i>). But what means this masquerading?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> I must see Roger, Pinky, and could think of no
way but this. I must tell him of the plot I overheard.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Potts.</span> I thought you were to leave that to me. Lost
your faith in your old friend?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> (<i>taking his hand</i>). Don't think that for a moment.
I could not remain at home. I did not dare tell Ruth, and I
must tell my thoughts to some one; they were driving me
frantic. Do find Roger for me&mdash;that's a dear fellow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Potts.</span> That is easier said than done. He must keep
out of the colonel's way, and that is his tent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> You have wits enough to manage that. Don't tell
him who is here, leave that to me; I mean to give him a surprise.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Potts.</span> Let a woman alone for keeping a secret. You
will undeceive him in five minutes. I know enough of the
fair sex for that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> If you were not Roger's best friend, I should say
something that you would not like.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Potts.</span> I fly to do your bidding. Don't empty your vial
of pent-up wrath over my defenceless shoulders. I should

monotonous; my blood boils for excitement; even the sight
of a pretty face wouldn't go bad. That reminds me. (<i>Takes

to prevent me from looking at a pretty girl's picture; and

you. You are suspected of some crime.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> I hope so with all my heart.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> You have a good heart, and, let me see&mdash;yes&mdash;that

<p><span class="smcap">Potts</span> (<i>slapping</i> <span class="smcap">Roger</span> <i>on back; laughs</i>). You are hard

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> (<i>addressing</i> <span class="smcap">Potts</span>). Your time is coming, sir.
&#8220;He laughs best who laughs last.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> Ha, ha! Potts, some time that heart of yours

return all your volleys.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> (<i>looking at</i> <span class="smcap">Roger's</span> <i>hand</i>). But what is this?
Some danger lurks near a friend; perhaps a brother.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> I have no brother.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> No; not a real brother, but&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> The colonel?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> (<i>excitedly</i>). Yes, yes. You must save him. He
shall owe his life to you. Some one calling himself friend is
his foe. (<i>Rising; forgets, and assumes natural voice.</i>)
He has done you a grievous wrong, but you will forgive
that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> That voice! (<i>Raises</i> <span class="smcap">Dorothy's</span> <i>veil</i>.) Dorothy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Potts.</span> A well-laid scheme, Roger, to hold a stolen interview

just five minutes, no longer. The colonel will return by that

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Forgive me for coming, Roger, but I was so

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> Anxious, little one? Why, what is the trouble?
Is it a quarrel with &#8220;my dearest friend Mollie&#8221;?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Don't speak like that. No one ever gives me credit
for any depth of feeling, just because I laugh and take the
good of life as it comes along.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> Which I hope you will always do, Dorothy dear.
Come, forgive me, and tell me your trouble.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Before the colonel left home after his illness, Mr.
Newcomb called one day. I entered the drawing-room, and
overheard a conversation which he was having with some
man,&mdash;a soldier in the colonel's regiment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> Did you hear the man's name?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Yes; Mr. Newcomb called him Gibbs. Oh, I was
so frightened, for I heard them plan to kill the colonel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> Kill the colonel? How? When?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> This man was, some night, to be placed as the
colonel's sentinel. That was to be the time and place.
&#8220;After Taps&#8221; they said.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> Have you told any one of this?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Only the major. It would never do to tell Ruth.
She worries enough without that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> And you have kept it all to yourself? No wonder
you were anxious. Dorothy, you are a treasure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> But tell me, how can you save Gordon?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> He says and thinks hard things of me, Dorothy.
(<i>Both rise.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> But you know at heart he does not mean it. It is
all through that horrid Newcomb.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> Yes; that horrid Newcomb.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Promise me that you will do your best to save him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> No need to promise that. He is your brother;
for that, if for no other reason, I must forget and forgive.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Roger, you have made me so happy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> Then, for all I have suffered, I ask no better
reward.</p>

deed, he is torn with conflicting emotions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pete.</span> I's powerful sorry for dear Massa Colonel. Wish
I could do somefin for him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Polly.</span> You do your work well, that will satisfy him.
(<i>Takes banjo from corner.</i>) But I tell you what, Pete, you
can do something for me. Play a dance tune on this banjo.
I haven't heard one since I left Oldtown. I can tell you
what, Pete, I knew how to dance once.</p>

How devoted he is to the colonel! Heigho! wish some one
was devoted to me. Nonsense; I don't care. I am so
happy, now that horrid war is over. I am ready to embrace
anybody and everybody. (<i>Extends arms</i>; <span class="smcap">Bijah</span> <i>steps

<p><span class="smcap">Bijah.</span> And I am just the man to appreciate it, Polly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Polly.</span> Bijah Bright! Bless my soul, how you frighten
me! Back from the war, are you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bijah.</span> Yes, Polly. When I left you, patriotism filled
my breast. I carried the flag, torn and tattered as it was,
and, contrary to your expectations, was not suspended in
mid-air. I lived for glory by day, and at night dreamed
sweet dreams. They were all of you, Polly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Polly.</span> Dreaming of me! Stuff and nonsense. Do you
take me for a brainless Down-Easter, that you come with
your sweet words and &#8220;palaverin&#8221; smiles. (<i>Dramatically.</i>)
Away! &#8220;I'll have none of you.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bijah</span> (<i>sinks into chair</i>). Won't you ever forgive me,
Polly, for that day in camp?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Polly.</span> Never!</p>

<p class="noindent">Besides, what should I have to say to you? A man who carries
in his pocket other girls' pictures, and spends all his

<p><span class="smcap">Bijah</span> (<i>aside</i>). Oho! I see where the shoe pinches.
(<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Polly</span>.) Why shouldn't I? That's what I'd like to
know. One moment you smile upon me, and my blood frantically
and joyfully perambulates through my veins; and the
next time my eager orbs behold you, an animated iceberg
would be a more cheerful companion. You needn't flatter
yourself that because you don't want me, no one else does.
You can bet your sweet life, Bijah Bright doesn't mean to
get left. No, ma'am. (<i>Taking picture out of pocket.</i>) Not
when he has such a sweet face as this to look at.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Polly</span> (<i>tossing head</i>). Don't flatter yourself that you can
make me jealous. Precious little thought I give to you or
your picture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bijah.</span> You are just dying to see who it is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Polly.</span> Indeed, I'm not. Some baby-faced simpleton.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bijah.</span> Come, Polly, it is too bad for you to treat me so
when I returned, hoping to share with you a secret.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Polly.</span> Secret! Oh, tell it to me, do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bijah.</span> Oh, no, Miss Primrose; I only make a confidant
of my friends.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Polly.</span> Well, I'll be friends for just ten minutes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bijah.</span> Will you though? Not by a large majority. No
friendship for me on the instalment plan.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Polly.</span> I'll be friends. (<i>Gives her hand.</i>) Now, tell
me quick.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bijah.</span> Ha, ha, ho, ho! I thought that would fetch it.
A woman's curiosity is not fireproof against a volley of
gossip.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Polly.</span> If you talk like that, I shall leave the room.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bijah</span> (<i>taking her arm; brings her down front</i>). No,
you won't, you are just dying to stay here. (<i>Holds picture
and forces</i> <span class="smcap">Polly</span> <i>to look at it</i>; <span class="smcap">Polly</span> <i>looks at picture, then
at</i> <span class="smcap">Bijah</span>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Polly.</span> Oh, Bijah! (<i>Hides her face on his shoulder.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bijah</span> (<i>laughing</i>). You had better hide your face, Polly.
Jealous of your own picture. That settles it: no more
&#8220;Nays&#8221; for me. We'll give the folks in Oldtown a surprise,
Polly, and the wedding shall be in the old church.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Polly.</span> Oh, Bijah! But don't be in a hurry. Be serious
and tell me about Mr. Roger.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bijah.</span> You know how he did old Newcomb up that day
in camp?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Polly.</span> Yes, that was the time when Pete was injured
and was sent home by the colonel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bijah.</span> Wal, Newcomb ain't done for yet. You see, when
Mr. Roger was in the bank, I was there too. Of course, I
wasn't president or director, Polly; only had to sorter keep
my eye on everybody, and I jest did. I saw something that
when it's known will be worse than dynamite, you jest bet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Polly.</span> It seems to me that you are a rolling-stone,
Bijah. The last time I heard of you before the war, you were
poultry farming in Oldtown.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bijah.</span> I could not make that work. I had read about
the money in raising poultry. Fortunes made in no time;
and my fancy pictured this enormous poultry farm. The
name of Bijah Bright immortalized. Oh, yes, there's money
in it, Polly; for I left all mine there, and had only experience
to put in my pocket.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Polly.</span> But what is the wonderful news you have to tell?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bijah.</span> Just wait. You want to be proud of me. It will
be a scorcher.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Polly.</span> Don't be so mysterious, Bijah; you don't know
everything in this world.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bijah.</span> No, and I don't want to. Let me be sure that the
heart of Miss Polly Primrose beats for me alone, and that
will satisfy my cravings for knowledge. Come, let us depart
to the charms of the culinary department. Methinks I see
visions of your pies, Polly. There in each other's genial
society we will partake of pie, and talk over that coming wedding
in Oldtown. (<i>Exeunt</i> <span class="smcap">Polly</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Bijah</span>, <span class="smcap">R.</span>; <i>enter</i>
<span class="smcap">Colonel</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Kilroy</span>, <span class="smcap">L.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Col.</span> Tell your master, Mr. Newcomb, that I will see him
this evening.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kil.</span> Indade, sir, he shall have your orders. (<i>Aside.</i>)
Faith, it's a foine pie they be afther baking for Newcomb.
By me powers, I wouldn't loike to be here at the cutting of
it. (<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Kilroy</span>, <span class="smcap">C.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Col.</span> (<i>sinks into chair at table</i>). It is hard to believe in
Newcomb's treachery; he has always seemed so warm a
friend. (<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Ruth</span>, <span class="smcap">R.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ruth</span> (<i>goes to</i> <span class="smcap">Colonel</span>). Gordon, what did that messenger
want? Who sent him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Col.</span> Randolph Newcomb.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ruth.</span> I thought as much; what was the message?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Col.</span> Asking permission to see me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ruth.</span> You did not consent?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Col.</span> Yes, Ruth, I am to see him this evening.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ruth.</span> He shall not see you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Col.</span> Ruth!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ruth</span> (<i>kneels and takes</i> <span class="smcap">Colonel's</span> <i>hand; music</i>). Gordon,
why will you let him poison your heart against Roger?
He is wily and cunning; you have proof of his treachery,
yet your heart, once loyal to your friend, cannot without a
struggle believe in his dishonor. Think no more of this
man, but tell me of Roger, and that night in camp.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Col.</span> Poor fellow, his experience has been a bitter one.
Shall I tell you the whole story, little one?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ruth.</span> Yes, Gordon, every word.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Col.</span> (<i>holding</i> <span class="smcap">Ruth's</span> <i>hand</i>). When the call for volunteers
was heard throughout the country, Roger's heart responded
to the call. Entering the service as a private, he
tried to forget his wrongs in earnest work. Knowing the
attempt upon my life, he sought the man who fired the shot.
Dowling was confined as prisoner, awaiting sentence. Roger
promised to help him, if he would confess the name of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
instigator of the crime. Dowling at last did so, and you
know who the guilty one proved to be. Oh, Ruth, to think
a tried and old friend could be so base. (<i>Covers face with
hands.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ruth.</span> Never mind, Gordon; perhaps better now to learn
his falseness than later; go on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Col.</span> Roger, knowing that Newcomb would not stop at
one attempt, determined to place himself in his way and act
the knave. Assuming a disguise, he so completely lost his
identity that Newcomb was well deceived, and before many
meetings employed Roger to finish the work which had
proved a blunder in the beginning. It was, as you know,
planned for the night that Roger would act as my sentinel:
the time after taps. Newcomb, always solicitous for my welfare,
was a daily visitor in camp, and that night was on the
watch to be sure that there was no blundering in the work.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ruth.</span> Gordon, it chills my blood to think of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Col.</span> To deceive him, Roger aimed at me, but fired at
him, and would have killed him on the spot, but Pete, having
been warned that my life was in danger, was on the watch,
and sprang upon Roger's back and caught his arm; the shot
grazed Newcomb's wrist.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ruth.</span> Brave Pete and noble Roger.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Col.</span> And to think, Ruth, that this was all for revenge.
Thank Heaven, he did not succeed in winning the heart that,
full of love and noble devotion, has been my inspiration in
my darkest hours. (<i>Embraces her; music ceases.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ruth.</span> Yet you will see Newcomb again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Col.</span> He wishes to compromise. (<i>Rises.</i>) Ruth, how
pale you look. When are the roses coming back to your
cheeks?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ruth.</span> When all is well with Roger, and you are happy
again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Col.</span> My heart will not be lighter until I ask Roger's
forgiveness for doubting him. I wonder why he does not
return?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ruth.</span> He is seeking more evidence to clear his name.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Col.</span> I am going to my study, Ruth. My head feels
heavy; perhaps a short sleep will refresh me. Ruth, you
too have much to forgive. I have doubted your brother.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ruth.</span> But not in your heart, Gordon. I have always
been sure of that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Col.</span> Thank Heaven that my harsh words have not
crushed out all your faith. (<i>Exeunt</i> <span class="smcap">Colonel</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Ruth</span>,

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Potts.</span> You see, we knew it all the time, but just how
and when Roger was to square it with Newcomb was
beyond our knowledge. You ought to have been there&mdash;just
a jolly row. When Roger threw off his disguise, you
should have seen Newcomb's face. Old Nick himself could
not have looked more insane.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Then the plot I overheard was no news to Roger?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Potts.</span> No, for under the disguise of Gibbs he held that
interview with Newcomb.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Right in this room, and I didn't know it. Well, I
never! But isn't it just glorious, Pinky. How did Roger
escape arrest?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Potts.</span> Hard as it was for the colonel to believe Newcomb
guilty, he, of course, took Roger's side. Newcomb
tried a game of bluff, but it didn't work. He is at large, but
we are only waiting for some new development. It will
come, and with it the downfall of Newcomb.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> He richly deserves it. Think of the wrong he has
done Roger.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Potts</span> (<i>taking both her hands</i>). Your faith and devotion
to Roger have just made me hungry. I want some one to
have faith in me, too. Now, don't breathe it, but I've just
&#8220;gone and done&#8221; it myself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> Pinky, what do you mean? You are in love with
a girl?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Potts.</span> Why, of course. You would not have me fall in
love with a spinster of many summers, would you? Guess
who it is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> (<i>trying to think</i>). I cannot for the very life of me
imagine who it can be.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Potts.</span> Let me whisper it. (<i>Whispers.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dor.</span> (<i>delighted</i>). No, really? Mollie? My dearest
friend. There, I knew she had some secret. Pinky, I could
just hug you, but I won't. I will reserve that demonstration
for Mollie. (<i>Rings bell.</i>) Do you remember what I told you
about the fascinating little woman? Now Roger will have
an opportunity to return some of your happy remarks.

<p><span class="smcap">Ruth.</span> Don't call us friends, Mr. Newcomb. The time

to me. I tried to be courteous, for you posed as my

colors, I can speak freely. I loathe and despise you; leave
this house.</p>

you once scorned my love, I cannot but admire your courage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ruth</span> (<i>scornfully</i>). Your love! That is an emotion
